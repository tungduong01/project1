                <p class="card-text">The Karamagara Bridge was built sometime in the 5th or 6th century during the era of the Byzantine Empire. The bridge consisted of a single pointed arch and is possibly the earliest known example of a pointed arch bridge.
                  Karamagara Bridge was part of larger Roman road that led to the city of Melitene in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. The bridge is no longer usable today because it was submerged after the completion of the Keban Dam in 1975. Before this, Karamagara Bridge was examined by the Middle East Technical University of Ankara.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The Bridge near Limyra is a relatively unknown, yet unique stone bridge – it is believed to be one of the oldest segmented arch bridges in the world. The bridge is located near the ancient city of Limyra and is the largest civil engineering structure of antiquity in the region.
                  The way the arches of the bridge were built gives the bridge an unusually flat profile, which was unique in Roman engineering at the time. Due to this fact and the lack of comparable structures, it has been hard to date the construction of the bride, which is estimated to be sometime in the 3rd century. Additionally, very little scientific research has been conducted on the bridge and there is no information about the bridge from ancient sources.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The Band-e Kaisar of Bridge of Valerian was a Roman stone arch bridge built in what is now Shushtar, Iran. At the time it was built, around 260 – 270 CE, the bridge was combined with a dam – making Band-e Kaisar the first of its kind in the country. The bridge/dam was the most eastern Roman bridge/dam, lying deep in Persian territory.
                  According to Persian history, Band-e Kaisar was named after the Roman Emperor Valerian, who was captured with his entire army by the Sassanid ruler Shapur I. The dam bridge was used until the late 19th century and today Band-e Kaisar is part of a larger UNESCO World Heritage Site in the area.</p>

It is located near the ancient city of Arsameia in southeastern Turkey. While an older bridge may have existed in the same spot, the current Cendere Bridge is dated to around 200 BCE.
                  A legion of the Imperial Roman army, Legio XVI Gallica, is credited with building the bride so they could begin a war with Parthia. Four Corinthian-style columns were added to bridge n honor of the Roman Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus (193–211), his second wife Julia Domna, and their sons Caracalla and Publius Septimius Geta. The Cendere Bridge is now apart of one of the most important national parks in Turkey, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Ponte Sant’Angelo is one of the most famous Roman bridges in the world. The bridge was commissioned by the Roman Emperor Hadrian to span the Tiber River from the city center in Rome to his newly constructed mausoleum, which is now known as the Castel Sant’Angelo. In the past, the bridge was called Pons Aelius, meaning the Bridge of Hadrian.
                  Pons Sant’Angelo was designed by the famous Italian sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini and it was completed in 134 CE. The bridge’s most distinctive feature are the numerous angel statues standing on the bridge’s pillars. Today, the bridge is solely used by pedestrians and provides a scenic view of the Tiber River and the Castel Sant’Angelo.</p>

                  Although the bridge is currently in good condition, it has had to be repaired several times throughout its history. Most of the bridge’s damage was due to wars rather than the elements. Various parts of Alcántara Bridge were destroyed at different time periods until the main pillars were completely repaired in 1969.</p>

                  According to Dio Cassius – a Roman statesman and historian – Pons Fabricius was built to replace a previous wooden bridge that had burned down. The bridge is named after Lucius Fabricius, the curator of the roads at the time. Despite its old age, the bridge has remained completely intact since it went up in 62 BCE and has remained in continuous use.</p>

This ancient arched stone slab bridge was built sometime around 850 BCE in Izmir, Turkey. At one point, the Caravan Bridge served as the checked entry point into the city of Izmir.
                  The river Meles is known for being the birthplace of the legendary Ancient Greek author Homer. The river and the Caravan bridge were prominently featured in Homer’s work.</p>

No one knows for sure how old the bride is but the Tarr Steps could date back to at least 1000 BCE.
                  The Tarr Steps consist of 17 giant slabs (total of 180 feet long) and are considered the best example of a clapper bridge. According to local legend, the Tarr Steps were built by the Devil so he could sunbathe on the stones. The bridge has been damaged in recent years by flood waters but has been rebuilt.</p>

In Mycenaean (last phase of the Greek Bronze Age from 1600 – 1100 BCE) times, the Arkadiko Bridge served as a highway between the cities of Tiryns and Epidauros.
                The Arkadiko Bridge was built sometime around 1300 – 1190 BCE and was part of a larger highway in the area. There are three other corbel arch bridges near Arkadiko, all similar in design and age.</p>
